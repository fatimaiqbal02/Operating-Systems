# Operating Systems
Welcome to my Operating Systems repository!
 
 # <h3>Introduction</h3>
This GitHub repository contains my practice codes during the 3rd semester of BSSE at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus. You'll find implementations in C for Operating System Programming.
From Shared Memory, Fork() call, exec() call, and Anonymous Pipes, NamedPipes to Semaphores (system V), Philospher-Dining Problem, Sockets and concept of LittleIndian and BigIndian, I have delved deep into these concepts to gain hands-on experience.
All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

# <h3>Features</h3>
The repository includes implementations for the following Operating System concepts:

- **Shared Memory:** Demonstrates inter-process communication using shared memory segments.
- **Anonymous & Named Pipes:** Illustrates communication between processes using pipes, both anonymous and named.
- **Semaphores (V):** Shows the use of semaphores to control access to shared resources and synchronization among processes.
- **Fork() Call:** Covers the fork() system call for creating new processes in a parent-child relationship.
- **Sockets:** Implements basic socket programming for network communication (single server and multiple clients) & (multiple servers and clients)
- **Dining Philospher Problem:** Implementation of Dining Philospher problem's solution using system V semaphores and Pthreads.
- **Threads:** Using Pthread library to create and work with multiple threads.
